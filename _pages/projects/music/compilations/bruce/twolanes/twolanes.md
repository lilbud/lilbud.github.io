## Info

Two Lanes, Two Hearts is a new fan compilation in the same vein as EarlMV’s excellent “The Turnpike is Closed, Nobody Goes Home” (From here on referred to as TTICNGH). Or the numerous compilations made by Flynn over the years. Similar idea to those before, a whole bunch songs blended together to form one cohesive playlist.

This compilation started life as “The Turnpike is (Still) Closed”, an upgrade project to the EarlMV compilation mentioned above. While listening to TTICNGH, I came up with some ideas to improve it, namely better quality sources that have been released since the original release. As I went on, I realized that it would be better to simply make my own compilation.

I took some cues from TTICNGH, in terms of the setlist, (and in some cases) using the same shows as the original compilation. The Price You Pay from Nassau is a great example of this, being one of the best versions of this song. I also used “Trapped” from the Vietnam Vets show, this show is widely regarded as one of Bruce’s best concerts, and this performance of Trapped is particularly poignant.

The setlist was a lot of personal preference. Both song choice and concert choice. I strove to use the highest quality sources that I could find. Making use of the following formats: Soundboard, IEM/AUD mix, FM recording, and higher quality Audience sources.

I included the source releases from which each song came from. I am nowhere near the inner circle to have personal contact with any of the fantastic tapers/labels involved with these releases. But would like to thank them for the work that they have done in making sure that an Artist's live history is preserved.

Enjoy!
