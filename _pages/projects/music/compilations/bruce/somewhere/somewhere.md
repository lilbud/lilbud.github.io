## Info

Created over a span of 8 months from January to August of 2021. 70 tracks spread across 8 discs totaling more than 8 hours. This started as wanting to make a compilation and having everything on it that I'd want. As on my earlier ones I had regrets about not putting certain songs on. So this was an attempt to rectify that.

There are 6 total 'volumes', each around a theme of sorts. This allowed me to go a bit crazy with setlists and have a clean break between volumes. Plus it makes for easier listening. Tracklist and dates below. Enjoy!

# Tracklist

In the interest of not making this page super long, I put the tracklist into a Google Doc, viewable [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oj52bqWPfkVWHd2OlQwWMH0dy-n1ZSdXw3hhNR-_dK8/edit?usp=sharing)
