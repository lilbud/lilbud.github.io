# Info:  
This was something I did a few months ago (March 2023). I really like this version that Elton did at Ryan White's funeral. But, all the circulating videos had various issues. The video was greatly desaturated, and the audio was not great (mono on one channel only, with the other being static.) I rebalanced the audio (simply removed the static and panned it center.) And, using a news broadcast as reference, tried to boost the color in the image. I think I did an okay job with it.
