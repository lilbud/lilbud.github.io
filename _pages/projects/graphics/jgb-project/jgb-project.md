### Project Info:
This project's goal is to create a cover for every circulating Jerry Garcia Band show from 1975-1995

As with my [Dick's Picks project](/projects/graphics/dp-project), the goal of this project was to quickly make a cover for every circulating JGB show. The process is exactly the same as that project, so just go to that page to read more.
