# Intro
Databruce is a database of Bruce Springsteen's performing career. Initially in SQLite, and then moved over to PostgreSQL to make it easier to interface with Heroku (which I use to host the associated Discord bot.)

## History
Below are blog posts detailing the history of this project. It has gone through multiple iterations, broadly referred to as "version 1" and "version 2". I wrote extensive pieces on the history of each of these versions. The short version is that V1 was an SQLite database, that I worked on from March 2023 until about January 2024. V2 was redone basically from scratch, using PostgreSQL and much better tools.

The [first one]({% post_url 2023-09-04-databruce %}) covers "Version 1" of the database, from March-September 2023. 

The [second one]({% post_url 2024-08-19-databruce %}) covers "Version 2", started in January 2024 and going up to August 2024.

I will likely at some point write another to cover developments from August 2024 until now. Each post is long enough as it is.

A website version of this database has been in the works since around August 2024 as well. I had hoped to get it online by now, but progress has been pretty slow due to also learning Django at the same exact time. This is not recommended.
