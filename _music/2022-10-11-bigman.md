## Info:
This is a compilation of the few dates Clarence Clemons guested with the Dead. Only 5 times from NYE 88 until around the same time next year. Clarence would also go on to play a number of shows with JGB in September 1989 as well. I picked songs where I thought he added something, but the baseline was trying to include every song he played with them. I left out a few songs due to not really being able to hear Clarence. Sometimes he gets a bit buried in the mix, and other times he isn't turned up all the way, but these issues are relatively minor. I tried to mimic a real show, but this was difficult due to the songs he appeared on.
