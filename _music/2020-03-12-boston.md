## Info
These 4 shows are pretty similar in setlist. So I started thinking about a compilation with this in mind, the best version of each song performed over the 4 nights.

I started work on this compilation around a week or so after releasing "Two Lanes, Two Hearts", my first fan compilation. This one was remarkably easier to make for one reason: All the tracks are from the same source, (Godfatherecords 'The Boston Godfather' box set, sourced from Steve Hopkins master tapes.)

So every track would be of similar quality due to being from the same source, which made mixing easier. Since I didn't have to rely on loud bits of audience to mask the transition, or weird fade-outs to accomplish the same.

I also wanted to get this done quickly so it wasn't ruined for me. Having worked on TLTH for around a month kinda ruined listening to it, since I remember where the fades are, and end up focusing on them instead of the music.
