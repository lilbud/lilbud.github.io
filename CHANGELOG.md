- 2024-04-03: Removed images from repo. Originally I had my covers repo as a subtree, which would be pulled everytime I pushed an update to it. This was sorta slow, both to update and to build. It used to be a bigger repo but even after shrinking many covers and getting it under 200MB, it still meant a long time to update. I found out that Jekyll's template system Liquid supports reading JSON files. I already use a JSON file to get covers for my databruce project from the git API. I managed to sort out iterating that JSON file to get all the covers that way. It also doesn't take that much longer to load to compared to the local files. One plus is that the covers will always be up to date with the covers repo. No need to me to pull updates manually.
