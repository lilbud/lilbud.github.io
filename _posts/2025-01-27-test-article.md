As previously reported, rehearsals began this week for Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band's upcoming tour, and some Bruce fans just can't wait until the trek kicks off next month to hear them perform.

The band has been rehearsing at the Vogel, part of the Count Basie Center of the Arts in Red Bank, New Jersey, and the Asbury Park Press reports fans have started to gather outside to try to get a listen to what the band has been working on.

"There is no other place I would rather be right now [than] in Red Bank at the Vogel", Joyce Carswell, of Asbury Park, tells the outlet. "I don't feel the cold — I'm so excited and pumped. They're rehearsing for the world tour, what's more exciting than this?"

Members of the E Street Band were spotted at the venue, and Bruce and his wife, Patti Scialfa, even acknowledged waiting fans with a wave. And while the sound of the rehearsals isn't exactly clear, fans were able to distinguish what songs were being played.

Some fans are hoping to actually see Bruce onstage this weekend. The annual Light of Day WinterFest show, which raises research money for Parkinson's and other related diseases, is happening Saturday at Basie's Hackensack Meridian Health Theatre. While The Boss is not officially on the bill, he has made surprise appearances at 12 of the last 21 Light of Day shows.

Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band's tour, their first since 2016, kicks off February 1 in Tampa, Florida, with U.S. dates running through April 14 in Newark, New Jersey.
