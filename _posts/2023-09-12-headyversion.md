# Info:

Below is a list of links to Headyversion, a site to rank songs from various Grateful Dead shows. They don't have an easy way to find shows, only submissions of songs. Which makes it difficult to find a specific show unless you want to sort through 4000 pages of submissions. Plus, the shows don't have a "normal" URL, its an id and date pairing based on when a show was first added. After a few hours in Python, I figured out the URL situation (found the max ID, 2219, and looped through the pages, grabbing the date from each and converting to YYYY-MM-DD format.)

The section is collapsed because its like 2000 links, they're sorted by date so it's much easier to find shows.

At some point I'll figure out how to make this page easier.
