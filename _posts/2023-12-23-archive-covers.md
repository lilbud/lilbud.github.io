## Updates:
- 2023-08-09: Thanks to underdog13a on BTX, all of the 2023 covers are now minimum 1000x1000px, with many being larger and even 1500x1500 (possibly max res).
- 2023-09-07: Thanks once again to underdog13a on BTX, who sent over the rest of 2023, and ALL of 2014 (minus 5/18, which is complicated).

## Intro
Covers for the Bruce Springsteen Archive series.

All covers acquired from either the archive releases I personally have bought (not that many), by asking around on various online communities, or searching online for the best cover. 

Almost every show was released except for a few choice ones. Quite a few shows were pulled when the switch was made from LiveNation to Nugs. The few not released include:

- March Madness (broadcast for free)
- New Orleans (presumably due to the large number of guests)
- 2014-02-16: where Bruce was supposedly drunk from a night of partying.
- Uncasville #2 was released and pulled about a month after release for unknown reasons in June 2014.

A note regarding the High Hopes tour: This was the first tour where they set out to record AND release every show on the tour. Shows would be released a little bit after the show itself. Early on they were released on LiveNation with very generic covers (the same exact pic, gray filter, and show info in white text. See 2014-05-18 for an example.) Once they were moved to Nugs, they got proper covers with an album appropriate typeface and style. This repo only has the new covers, I'll try and track down the original covers, but its a lesser priority to getting all the nugs covers.
