## Info
Discord Bot that works with the Databruce project

This repo is the code behind the Discord bot, the code is hosted on Heroku.

See this [repo](https://github.com/lilbud/databruce) for the Databruce project, which is an PostgreSQL database + associated Python scripts that handle building/updating the database.

While the bot is largely my own code (plus bits from various online forums/posts/stack overflow pages/documentation/etc.) The inspiration for the bots design is owed to the Not Fade Away discord server (and the bots creator, Deadandy), who has a similar bot which provided much of the concept for what I wanted my bot to look like visually. As the first iteration was simply just normal discord text messages with setlists contained in a code block.

Its not a 1:1 exact copy of their embed, but enough to where I feel I should probably mention it.
