It's been said that Bob Weir could control the weather, with many stories of shows where either they influenced the weather (rain starting during Bob's song Looks Like Rain), or the rain influenced them (the "Rain" set in Pittsburgh 1995).

The Dead and Company show in Philly on August 21, 2021 would be no exception.

Around 7pm, Dead and Company took the stage at Pierre's Good Citizens Ballpark in Philadelphia. Thanks to Tropical Storm Henri, the forecast called for torrential downpours, and pour it did. A rainbow even appeared over the stadium during Jack Straw. Because of this, D&C opted for a shorter 2hr show, skipping set break and playing straight through until about 10pm.

Unfortunately, I was not at that show. At that time, I hadn't even really listened to the Dead. Of course, I knew songs like Touch of Gray (and it's video), Casey Jones, and maybe one or two others. But, they were not a band I really listened to. That show, and the notable circumstances surrounding it, piqued my interest and got me to check out the Dead ("get on the bus" if you will). About a week or so later I hit play on Cornell '77, widely considered to be their best show. For me, that is when it all began.

Now, four and a half years later, with hundreds of shows under my belt, I am writing this the day after Bob Weir died. It feels weird to hear and even weirder to say. It's something I knew would happen eventually, same goes for all older musicians, but I really thought Bob would play until he literally dropped on stage. It wouldn't surprise me if that was his plan.

Not counting couch touring the 2022 Tour, I only got to see the man live in person once. Dead and Company at Pierre's Good Citizens Ballpark in Philadelphia on June 15, 2023. It was billed as D&Cs "Final Tour", and despite the Sphere it has remained technically true. 

At the time I had only seriously been listening to the Dead for a year or so, and I knew I had to be there as (barring acts of God) it was going to be my last chance as I'm not exactly Sphere rich. Managed to talk the powers that be into scoring tickets, section 128, row 25, seats 5-8. Bit far, but getting a great view of the stage and lights.

The show was more than I could've asked for. I have a tendency to stumble my way into seeing "brag worthy" shows. Having seen Bruce's longest US show with a truly monster setlist, even if most of it went over my head. This was one of those shows, getting many of my favorites like Brown Eyed Women, an excellent Estimated > Eyes, Standing on the Moon, and Ripple. Even getting to do the Not Fade Away chant during the encore break. I can even proudly say that I got the last Dark Star > El Paso, confusing the hell out of my family with how excited I got seeing Bobby pick up the acoustic. Standing on the Moon was simply stunning, Bobby taking the vocals gave the song a whole new meaning. 

> Standing on the moon
> With nothing left to do
> A lovely view of heaven
> But I'd rather be with you

He took over duties on many of the Jerry ballads like Moon, but also Days Between, Stella Blue, and Wharf Rat. But Moon in particular is special, as it sounded like Bobby was singing to Jerry. Jerry, looking down from that crescent in the sky on us all, watching the latest incarnation of the band he helped start all those years ago carry the music forward. Bobby was singing to him, wanting nothing more than to be on that back porch in San Francisco on a warm July night.

Bobby joins him now, along with Phil, Donna, Brent, Keith, Vince, and Pigpen. All of them, looking down from that same crescent, watching the music of the Dead live on. Because even now that the Dead is nearly all gone, the Dead will never die. Their music can and should carry on, because the music will never, ever stop.
